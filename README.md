# DotNetK70Controller
## Intro
The code will be messy while I work on it!
Linux and OSX versions may be coming soon.

LED Controller for the Corsair K70 RGB that aims to allow users to create lua scripts that control the keyboard.

Make sure that the Corsair Utility Engine has the keyboard set to disable device lighting or the two sources will conflict and cause insane flickering.

## Lua Integration
There are example scripts in the lua folder.
Better documentation coming soon!
